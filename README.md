<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Concept
This is a small prototype to test how a 4D dungeon would work. The player is able, when the map allows, to travel in all 4 spacial directions, transposing holes in the z dimension (aka ceilings and floors) represented by stairs and in the w dimension represented by a specific light color. The objective is to find a key and espace through the door.
